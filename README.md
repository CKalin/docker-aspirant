# docker-aspirant

Welcome to the application process for Trusted Shops Developer enrollees! This project contains a docker-compose environment, 
within you can do all tasks that you are commissioned with.

## Getting started

1. First, install docker (and docker-compose, on linux environments)
2. Clone this repository where-ever you like to.
3. Open a terminal and run `docker-compose up -d`
4. You should now have a working environment, and can start working.

To use tools and more, we provided you with some stuff here:

``` docker exec -it tsas-tools bash```

This connects you to the shell of a docker-container, ready to use with NodeJS, Angular, PHP CLI, MySQL CLI and many more. 
You can also use tools you like, for sure.

## Nice to know:

### Ports and Access to the containers:
#### MySQL: 
Port: 9306
User: root
Password: Tru5tâ‚¬d

#### HTTP:
http://localhost:9980
